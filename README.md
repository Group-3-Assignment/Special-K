## 1 Introduction

### 1.1	State the problem,  why it is important/relevant to you and/or more broadly the society 

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the world’s leading cause of disability.  MDD is a significant medical condition that can impact usual behaviours such as physical functions, mood and behaviour. With risks being associated with the illness such as self-harm, drug abuse, health-disorders and suicide. Unfortunately, it has been estimated that up to one third of those diagnosed with MDD suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This is characterised by having no response to at least one form of antidepressant medication. Furthermore, those who do respond to current forms of antidepressant treatments experience a significant delay in their therapeutic benefit. This delay can further increase the suffering, burden and potential risks associated with MDD.  

However, ketamine is a new form of treatment has been paving the way for a new generation of antidepressants. Ketamine is a non-competitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist that is believed to work by prompting connections to regrow between brain cells that are involved in mood disorders. Studies have found that ketamine is effective in patients who are refractory to current anti-depressant medications with results being shown in as little as four hours. 

Psychological phenomena are recognised as complex in that they are determined by a potentially huge number of variables that are interacting with each other non-linearly. Our group has decided to break it down and allow the boundary for this complex system to be treating people with major depressive disorder with ketamine. 

Hence, our group decided that we would look at current studies on the effectiveness of ketamine treatment on treatment resistant depression and assess the probability of ketamine’s future as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder. We will use data from current research studies to assess a probability of this working in the future, then use variables related to the treatment of major depressive disorder and real world thinking to hypothesis the likelihood of this treatment working outside of clinical setting. The model that we will use to assess this is yet to be chosen. Lastly, we will synthesis this information to create either a stock and flow model or casual loop diagram to provide a visual aid for the readers. 
 

## 2 Context, Background, Information, Justification

### 2.1 Research and Review Literature, News, Digital Media, Drivers, and How the Problem is Being Addressed by the Academia Industry, Government, etc 

Overall, Ketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression seems to be well reported/portrayed by current news and media. Reliable news websites such as the ABC have heralded that Ketamine is ‘revolutionary’ in elderly patients with depression and even conservative news websites such as Fox News in America have created news articles stating, ‘How ketamine is revolutionising the way we treat depression’. 

Furthermore, current research literature does find a positive correlation in the treatment of ketamine in major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression. As there has been a show in its efficacy studies are undertaking different forms of treatment such as intranasal routes and intravenously to find the most efficient form of treatment. Studies are also branching out to study it’s effect on other mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar and schizophrenia. With government websites show that there are currently multiple studies being undertaken at a Phase 3 and Phase 4 level. 

Correspondingly, the people participating in studies such as those are the main driving force behind this complex system. The relationship they experience between their mental health issues (MDD), allow key variables to be derived and studied. Need to write more about drivers.


However, in almost all forms of literature it is stated that there is a need for further research before we gain a full understanding of the treatment. 

### 2.2 Identify the system + stakeholders. For this you will need to construct a “rich picture” that captures the essential elements 

  Am going to add image for this 

### 2.3 Identify current models or prevailing frames that are being used to address the problem 

When researching the efficiency of ketamine on MDD and TRD there were three current models and prevailing frames that appeared in multiple forms of research. They were, ‘The Animal Models of Depression’, ‘The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRDS) and the function of the ‘N-Methyl-D-Aspartate System’.  

### 2.4 Discuss how prevailing models/frames are preventing the problem from being fully addressed

Need to complete this section. 

## 3 Conceptual Models

### 3.1 Based on your self-study of the supermarket of models, explain the three models you have chosen to look at the problem 

The three models that our group has chosen to focus our research on are the Markov Processes, the Qualitative Decision-Making Model (and what we are going to use the hypothetical data in) and Stock and Flow Models/Casual Loop Diagrams. 


### 3.2 Explain how each of the three models work (brief) and how it will be applied in your case

Since our idea was to draw data from existing research papers and then use this to corroborate the probability of the efficiency for future outcomes on the treatment of ketamine on MDD and TRD. It was important that we chose models that we could directly apply the data to with a sound statistical outcome. As the Markov Processes are able to involve extensive mathematical modelling of clinical trials including the probability distributions chosen to reflect prior information and the relationship between multiple sources of prior information, we found they would be ideal for our research. 
	
When hypothesising how this treatment would work in the outside world we decided to follow a qualitative decision model making model. This was decided as it allowed up to give weight to each of the potential variables that the agent may face in the real world when trying to continue the treatment. More thought is still to be had on this or if this is the model we want to use. 

We also wanted to provide our readers with a visual paradigm that would allow them to gain a structural understanding of the system. This would allow the readers to view the casual structure that produce the observed behaviour that was found in multiple research studies. We have chosen to either focus on a stock and flow model or a casual loop diagram. Stock and flows reveal information about the rates of change of a systems element and the measures of the variables of the system. Therefore, allowing our readers to grasp a full understanding of the issue at hand and the outcome is produced in an easy and succinct model. If we were to use Casual Loop Diagrams we would focus on the Drifting Goals archetype and use this in the hypothetical situation of the treatment being used outside of a clinical setting. Therefore, displaying what drives either the success or failure of the treatment. It would also be interesting to display a the ‘Addiction Archetype’ if we decided to try the potential hypothesis that people could become addicted to the drug and how that could affect treatment.  

	
### 3.3 Desrcibe any data sources (real or hypothetical) that are needed to construct the three models. Use illustrative drawings and diagrams where possible. 

The data sources we will be using will come from reviewing the available studies are literature. We will use the parameters of number of patients, efficiency and _______ to work out the future likelihood of this being an efficient treatment of MDD and TRD.

| Authors | Subjects | Design | Rating Scale | Ketamine Efficacy |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Popova et al, 2016|223|INtranasal (S)-K, 56 or 84mg twice weekly+AD for 4 weeks (n=114), PBO+AD for weeks (n=109)|MADRS|Efficacy at week 4. No efficacy at day 1, week 1, 2, & 3|
|Daly et al, 2018|67|Intranasal, (S)-K, 84mg twice weekly for 4 weeks (n=35), PBO(n=31)|MADRS|Efficacy at day 1, and 2, week 1, and 2|
| Canusco et al, 2018|67|Intranasal (S)-K, 84mg twice weekly for 4 weeks (n=35), PBO(n=31)|MADRA| Efficacy at 4hrs and day 1. Efficacy at day 25|
|Domany et al, 2018|41|K(n=22) 1mg/kg thrice weekly for 21 days by oral route, PBO(n=19)|MADRS|Efficacy at 40 minutes, 4hrs, day 3, week 1, week 2 and 3|

For our hypothesis on future durability we will create 5 "case studies" in which we will provide qualitative outcomes from the study and issues that might affect them in their daily life in continuing the study. We will then provide numerics to each of the variables that affect each agent in the case study. After doing this we will apply the quantitative data to a model to assess its potential to work in the real world.
